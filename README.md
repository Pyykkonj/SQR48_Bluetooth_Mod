# Retrofit Bluetooth mod for BLAUPUNKT Kingston SQR48 car head unit 

This is a freetime modification/extension for Blaupunkt Kingston SQR48 head unit from 80's to add bluetooth functionality on it. The main principle was to keep the head unit appearance untouched. No external signals for added bluetooth are shown, so it will fit perfectly on restored 80's era car.

This is developed for my own needs and might include bugs. I'm not responsible if your cat dies.

## Functionalities

Because I didn't wanted add any extra buttons or control for the bluetooth, all bluetooth control functionalities are "improvised".

* Head unit changes audio input between radio/Cassette-player and Bluetooth depending if bluetooth device is connected. Eg. if phone is connected, head unit is in "Bluetooth Mode" otherwise audio is played from radio/Cassette-player.

* Bluetooth play/pause/next/previous can be controlled by Head unit's Cassette player's next/prev buttons. 

* All audio from Bluetooth goes throught Head unit's audio amplifer stage, so audio tune knobs and "signal indicators" on the LCD works. 

* If Head unit is turned off, Bluetooth is turned off.

## Hardware
